## Set Up 'Play With Docker'

This workshop uses [Play With Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com), so everyone can have the same experience and we don't rely on WiFi to push/pull Gigabytes of images.
You can still follow the instructions locally with your own engine.

**Don't forget to save on your laptop all your exercises before leaving the workshop**.

**1.** Go to https://labs.play-with-docker.com

![pwd](pwd.png)

**2.** Click on the `Login` dropdown, choose `Docker` and sign in using your `Docker Hub` credentials

**3.** Start !

**4.** A new session is opened, which will be closed in 4 hours. You can add multiple new instances and delete them. Each one has it's own engine and own prompt. You can also ssh directly to it if you feel more comfortable with your own terminal. Now **add a new instance**.

**5.** Login to the Docker Hub using your credentials

```sh
$ docker login
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
Username: dapworkshop
Password:
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /root/.docker/config.json.

Login Succeeded
```

**6.** Run the workshop image.

We prepared an image containing everything needed for the workshop (docker CLI, docker-compose, docker-app, swarm, ...) and your prefered editors (nano, emacs, even vi!). Please run it, everything will happen in this container. 

```sh
$ docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /root/workshop:/workshop --network host dapworkshop/workshop

## How to save your work

**You may want to set a reminder to save your exercises locally before leaving the workshop. We will remind you at the end as well.**.

For those using PWD, you can copy/paste the `SSH` address and use it to `SCP` (Secure File Copy through SSH) all your files:

![ssh](ssh.png)

```sh
# run this locally
$ scp -rp ip172-18-0-23-bg01fj0v0j3g00d0atfg@direct.labs.play-with-docker.com:/root/workshop .
```
